One function that takes two arguments and does some kind of Boolean comparison between them. The data type of the arguments doesn't matter for this function

One function that does something interesting with strings after accepting two strings as arguments. This can be simple concatenation, but you are encouraged to look into other, more interesting string applications

One function that takes an array and a number and uses them in a for loop of some kind. This should not be a simple index dereference (looking up one value by its index). Make it something more interesting
