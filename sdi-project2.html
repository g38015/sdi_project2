<p>The Skiing Adventure Continues...</p>
<p>I continued on with my current story from the previous project.  First we are going to check to see if it snowed last night and if the roads are clear.  We are going to keep track of how much it snowed if it did snow.  I am going to pack up the car and go to the selected resort.  At the resort I will be putting on my boots and skis.  Next I am going to ski several runs and record each run.  At the end of the day I did not make it to all of the runs.  I did add a run into the mix.</p>
<p>I am going to go skiing the next day:)</p>
